# What is this?

Currently a work-in-progress, I plan to implement realistic physics in 2D user interface on roblox.

# How can I try this out?

As there are no stable releases yet, you can simply sync the repo to roblox using rojo or run the following command:

```bash
rojo build "gravity simulator.rbxlx"
```

And open the generated place file.
